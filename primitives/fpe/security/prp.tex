\heading{Pseudorandom Permutation.}
One of the primary security notions considered for FPE schemes is that of pseudorandom permutation (PRP) security.\

This is formalized by the game $\gPRP{}$ shown in \figref{fig-fpe-prp}, associated to FPE scheme $\FPE$ and adversary $\advA$. 
 The game initially samples a random challenge bit $b$, with $b=1$ indicating it is in ``real'' mode and $b=0$ that it is in ``random" mode.
 As per our conventions noted in \secref{sec-defs},  the tables $T$ and $R$ are intialized to $\bot$ everywhere.
 Now the adversary $\advA$ also has access to an evaluation oracle $\FnO$ that takes an input a nonce $\nonce$ and message $\msg$.
For a new $\nonce,\msg$ the oracle either returns a uniformly random element from $\Dom{\FF}$ which have not previously been returned (for $b=0$), or an evaluation under $\Enc{\FF}$ (for $b=1$).
That is, $\FnO$ is either a random permutation for each choice of $\nonce$ or $\Enc{\FPE}$ with a random secret key.
As a last step, the adversary outputs a bit $b'$ that can be viewed as a guess for $b$. 
 The advantage of adversary $\advA$ in breaking the prp security of  $\FPE$ is defined as $\prpAdv{\FPE}{\advA} = 2\Pr[\gPRP{\FPE}(\advA)]- 1$.
